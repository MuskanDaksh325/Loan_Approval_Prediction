# Loan_Approval_Prediction
# Project Description
This project is focuesd on predicting whether a loan application will be approved or not based on various applicant details using machine learning techniques. This project is completed as part of the online internship organized by Alfido Tech. The goal is to help automate the loan approval process by building a predictive model from historical loan data. After trying and testing 4 different algorithms, the best accuracy is achieved by Logistic Regression (78.861), followed by RandomForest (74.796) and KNN (75.609), while Decision Tree performed the worst (69.105).
